## Context

Full-stack software engineers are always in demand by businesses, but not all business can hire a permanent full-stack team with the post-pandemic talent crunch.

Yet, software engineers who are already employed often look for opportunities outside of work hours to earn a side income. This app offers project-based work to a curated list of full-stack software engineers who register on the Full-Stack Otter, in a similar vein to platforms like Toptal or Fiverr.

Any work from clients here is managed by a project manager, end-to-end. Work pipeline is generated after an initial consulting session between the project manager and the client to not only take client requirements, but to manage expectations and timelines realistically. It is only after jobs are properly qualified by the project manager that they get posted onto the app's portal for the engineers to bid on.

Once the required number of engineers enrol in a project, the project manager kicks off development and unlock a kanban board for the engineers to use for progress to be tracked until completion and production (agile scrum).
